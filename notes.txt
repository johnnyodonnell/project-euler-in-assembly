    - https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107/guide/x86-64.html
        * Contains a list of the registers conventionally owned by
            the caller and registers conventionally owned by the callee
        * Explains the use instructions such as `mov %ebx, %ebx`
    - https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs033/docs/guides/x64_cheatsheet.pdf
        * Not a great tutorial, since there are some typos in the doc
        * Mentions that the base pointer has mostly been eliminated
            in 64-bit architecture
        * By convention, function arguments are pushed onto the stack
            in right-to-left order
    - https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/introduction-to-x64-assembly-181178.pdf
        * "assembly code knowledge is indispensable when diagnosing malware"
        * An extended precision data type is supported, which is an
            80-bit version of float (32 bits) and double (64 bits)
        * Intel provides a "loop" instruction, which could be pretty
            convenient
        * By convention, "Larger return values (structs) have space
            allocated on the stack by the caller"
        * "Registers RAX, RCX, RDX, R8, R9, R10, and R11 are considered
            volatile and must be considered destroyed on function calls."
        * "RBX, RBP, RDI, RSI, R12, R14, R14, and R15 must be saved in
            any function using them"
                - Must be saved and restored
